Here's an example of using the ls command and piping the output to xargs to move multiple Python files into different folders with a src folder:
ls *.py | xargs -I {} sh -c 'folder=$(dirname "{}") && mkdir -p "$folder/src" && mv "{}" "$folder/src"'

This command uses the ls command to list all files with the .py extension in the current directory, and pipes the output to xargs. The -I {} option tells xargs to replace {} with the input from ls one by one.

The shell script folder=$(dirname "{}") extracts the parent directory of each file listed by ls. mkdir -p "$folder/src" creates a src directory within each parent directory, and mv "{}" "$folder/src" moves the file into the src directory.

The -p option for mkdir is used to create the src directories as needed, and to avoid errors if the directories already exist. The && operator is used to run the mv command only if the mkdir command succeeds, i.e., if the src directory was successfully created.


Extract python files and store them in moocpython2023 folder.
ls tmcdata/mooc-programming-23/*/src/*.py | xargs -I {} sh -c 'file="{}"; parent=$(dirname "$(dirname "$file")"); cp "$file" "moocpython2023/$(basename "$parent")-$(basename "$file")"'
