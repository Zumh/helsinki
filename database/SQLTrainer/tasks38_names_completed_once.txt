Get the names of all courses that have been completed at least once.
FINNISH - 
SELECT DISTINCT K.nimi FROM Kurssit K, Suoritukset S WHERE K.id=S.kurssi_id;

ENGILSH - 
SELECT DISTINCT C.name FROM Courses C, Accomplishments A WHERE C.id = A.course_id;

MY SOLUTION -
# grou by course id then count the course at least one course is completed
# it work but wrong thought flow
SELECT C.nimi FROM Kurssit C, Suoritukset A WHERE C.id = A.kurssi_id GROUP BY C.id HAVING COUNT(*) >= 1;
